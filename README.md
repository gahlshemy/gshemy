Hi, Iâ€™m @gshemy. Iâ€™m interested in math and starting to develop some interest in programming, at least as it relates to solving math problems. 
Iâ€™m still learning intro python but would like to learn more c++ eventually. 
I'm also starting my website! The goal is to eventually post blogs about math and my general life experiences. I'd also like my website to be a 
place I can upload projects and things that I'm proud of. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have programming tips, website-making tips, 
and general life advice.
